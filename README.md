BME280 Weather sensor with Microchip PIC MCU &amp; C# Monitor


MCU: PIC18F45K22

DEV. BOARD: EasyPIC PRO v7

SENSOR: BME280

IDE: mikroC for PIC

AUTHOR: Mario OletiÄ‡


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Drivers for the BME280 sensor have been developed in this project. They are adapted for the Microchip PIC18F45K22 microcontroller and the mikroC programming language. Sensor data is sent to a PC. To display data on a PC, a small program was developed using C# Windows Forms.
